## This is my first React project for Analysis And design systems project 🚴. I pushed codes here from my previous github account <a href="https://github.com/Gholizadef1/Kima/tree/dev">here</a>. KIMA stands for Ketab Yar-e Mehraban Ast 😏.
### The idea of this project came from Fidibo and Goodreads in order to make a community for people who love reading books and know more about literature world.
### The application had both web and mobile part, I coaperated in web front-end team.
### Used libraries:
#### MUI
